0.  8bit BMP and GIF (256 colors). 24bit BMP, JPEG, and PNG (16.8 million colors). 
1.  .gif format will support animation
2.  Loseless will reconstruct the original image perfectly but will be larger in size. Lossy degrades the image slightly to save 
    space.
3.  JPEG is lossy compressed.
4.  When a file is deleted on FAT, the system will modify the file to signal it is deleted and space can be recycled. The file cluster
    is then moved to "free cluster", but nothing is done to the cluster itself.
5.  To make sure files cannot be recovered, have a tool write 0's or a random value in every block of the hard drive.
6.  Header file for C that has fixed width ints to allow for specific bit lengths.
7.  uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program will set aside a certain amount of memory for an int.
8.  For bytes, "BYTE" is 8, "WORD" is 32, "LONG" is 32, and "WORD" is 16.
9.  BM
10. bfSize is the size (in bytes) of the bitmap and biSize is is the number of bytes required.
11. If biHeight negative, the origin is in the top left corner and the bitmap is a top-down. 
12. biBitCount
13. If the file doesn't exist or cannot be written to, it may return "NULL".
14. It always reads "1" because we are reading the files one struct at a time.
15. If bi.biWidth is 3, padding is 3.
16. fseek sets your position in the file forward by the offset you specify (beginning/current position/end of file)
17. SEEK_CUR is your current position in the file.
18. Not sure? Definitely not David. I got the image to show up though.
